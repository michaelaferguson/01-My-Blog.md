## How to Enjoy Winter in Northern Colorado
As winter approaches, it may seem like the outdoor activities in Estes Park and the surrounding areas are limited, but that is a myth we are here to debunk. The obvious and most popular approach to winter fun is hitting the slopes outside of Denver, but we'd like to suggest some activities and places to go to kick the woes of winter in the face and enjoy Colorado all year long!


### In Estes Park
- Snowshoe! Seriously, the options are pretty unlimited in the National Park. If you frequent the trails in the summer, strap on those snowshoes and go see your favorite spots in a winter wonderland. 
- Though the historic Hidden Valley Ski area closed in 1991 after being in operation for 60 years, backcountry skiiers still frequent the area. There's plenty of other areas to ski and places like The Mountain Shop have gear for rent and reccommendations for you. 
- For the hikers or climbers not ready to let go of the rocky trails and dry walls, Lumpy Ridge is your spot year-round. Its North facing walls take on much of Colorado's 300 days of sunshine and the area stays relatively warm and dry throughout the winter. 
- If you're not wanting to get out and play but enjoy a cozy afternoon indoors, some of our favorite spots are: Kind Coffee, Inkwell & Brew, and the lobby of the Ridgeline Hotel.
