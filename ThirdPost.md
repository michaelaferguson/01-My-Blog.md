## A weekend trip to Nederland, CO
Nederland is one of those places that you have to be really seeking out to find. It's possible you could just be driving through if you take the scenic route to Black Hawk or Idaho Springs, but it's basically a blink-and-you'll-miss-it type of town. Nederland is known for its quirky locals, the winter skiing at Eldora, and the annual "Frozen Dead Guy Days" festival in March. Boulderites escape the city and zip up the Boulder canyon in the summer, but otherwise it stays relatively quiet in the off-season. 
I took a weekend trip in July and it did not disappoint.If you're looking for a nice getaway (without the bells and whistles), then here's a guide for where to eat, what to do, the best spot to pitch your tent, and some other fun bits you won't want to miss:

# Getting to Nederland
If coming from Estes Park, take highway 7 down through Allenspark and Ward - enjoy the curves and watch out for wildlife! If coming from the Denver area, you have options. The Boulder canyon aka Hwy 119 is beautiful but can get crowded with river floaters. Coal Creek Canyon (Hwy 72) or Golden Gate Canyon (Hwy 46) are the next best routes to get up to the town who's motto is "Life is better up here".

# Where to Stay
I set up camp on one of the many dispersed camping spots available on National Forest land. There are also many options to rent a backcountry pass to pack in/pack out of Indian Peaks Wilderness area/Rocky Moutain National Park. If sleeping on a bed is more your comfort, the Goldminer Hotel is adorable and reasonably priced.

# Where to Eat
Given the town is only 1.55 sq. miles, the options for food aren't super plentiful, yet somehow they have managed to have at least one of any type of food you'd want. 

# What to Do
The hiking trails are plentiful around Nederland as it borders Indian Peaks Wilderness and Rocky Mountain National Park. The Fourth of July Trailhead is an excellent spot to start and explore. Parking is extremely limited and everyone and their dog (literally) will be there too - take advantage of the free shuttles that run regularly from town.
We were a little overwhelmed by the miles of connecting trails and opted for the one-mile trek to Lost Lake for sunrise. It wouldn't be a proper morning without some camp coffee - you can pick up your own Jetboil, Yeti and GSI coffee maker from Hyk!
Here's a friendly reminder to practice Leave No Trace responsibilities and be bear (and other animal) aware! We knew bears frequent the area we camped in, so we took precautions to keep ourselves and ultimately, the bears safe. Respect the wildlife and they'll respect you! We were fortunate enough to have a graceful encounter with a mother and baby moose on the trail:
