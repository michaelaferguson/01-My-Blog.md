# How We Got Here 

Before Hyk was what it is today, a long journey of transformation awaited the original shop space that Hyk now occupies. For many years, 149 E. Elkhorn held a T-shirt shop called Main Street Ts. 
## October 2017
The shop was closed, gutted, and a four month long renovation began. 
We hit the drawing boards, in hopes of bringing a visual space that was utterly new and fresh to Estes Park. Everything had to go in order to achieve our vision. Here's how the shop looked when the years and years of built up merchandise was taken out from Main Street Ts:

The walls and floors were a high priority to transforming the space. Along with the help of local carpenters, we spent hours cutting our ** to customize the back wall and custom dressing room door. The floors were freshly placed as well - no more blue and dirt carpert, yay!

Next up was new clothing fixtures and lighting. Watching the shop come together made the cold and dark winter days worth it. We made our own warmth and light - and had fun while doing it!

## January 2018
When the weather warmed up just a bit, we got started on the exterior renovations. We removed the orange awning and terracotta tiles on the roof to start fresh.

A wooden beam entry was added, and ledge stone veneers replaced the previous tan and green stones.

We were thrilled with our wood and metal sign to hang over our front door. People walking by were quite curious, and many locals said they enjoyed seeing the transformation unfold from their daily walks with their dogs or to work. 

## February 2018
We worked on finishing the final touches of the interior, added final signage inside, and begin stocking the store with outdoor gear from brands new to Estes Park.

Annabelle, our fearless shop dog, was of consistent help and oversaw the production of things.

## March 2018
On March 8th, we opened our doors as Hyk for the first time. We hosted an open house and ribbon cutting with our friend and Mayor, Todd Jirsa.
